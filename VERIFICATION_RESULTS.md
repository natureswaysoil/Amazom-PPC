- **Campaigns Monitored**: 253 active campaigns
- **Processing Time**: ~50 seconds per run
- **Status**: Fully operational

## 🔄 Next: Deploy Dashboard Integration

Your function is working perfectly, but it's running the **old version** without explicit dashboard integration. To enable dashboard status/results posting:

### In Cloud Shell:

```bash
cd ~/Amazom-PPC
git pull origin main
./grant-access.sh
./deploy.sh
```

### After Redeployment, You'll Get:

1. **Health Endpoint**: Quick status check without running full optimization
   ```bash
   curl "${FUNCTION_URL}?health=true"
   # Returns: {"status": "healthy", "dashboard_ok": true, ...}
   ```

2. **Verify Connection**: Test Amazon API without optimization
   ```bash
   curl "${FUNCTION_URL}?verify_connection=true&verify_sample_size=3"
   # Returns: Sample of 3 campaigns
   ```

3. **Dashboard Integration**: Every optimization run will POST to:
   - `/api/optimization-status` (start, progress updates)
   - `/api/optimization-results` (final enhanced payload)
   - `/api/optimization-error` (if failures occur)

4. **Dry Run Mode**: Test without making actual changes
   ```bash
   curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"dry_run": true, "features": ["bid_optimization"]}' \
     "${FUNCTION_URL}"
   ```

## 🚀 Ready to Deploy?

Your code changes are pushed to GitHub. Just run in Cloud Shell:

FUNCTION_URL=$(gcloud functions describe amazon-ppc-optimizer --region=us-central1 --gen2 --format='value(serviceConfig.uri)')

# Health check
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-identity-token)" \
  "${FUNCTION_URL}?health=true"

# Should now return: {"status": "healthy", "dashboard_ok": true, ...}
```
